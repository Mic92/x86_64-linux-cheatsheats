Description ¶

Returns program control from system management mode (SMM) to the
application program or operating-system procedure that was interrupted
when the processor received an SMM interrupt. The processor’s state is
restored from the dump created upon entering SMM. If the processor
detects invalid state information during state restoration, it enters
the shutdown state. The following invalid information can cause a
shutdown:

-   Any reserved bit of CR4 is set to 1.
-   Any illegal combination of bits in CR0, such as (PG=1 and PE=0) or
    (NW=1 and CD=0).
-   (Intel Pentium and Intel486TM processors only.) The value stored in
    the state dump base field is not a 32-KByte aligned address.

The contents of the model-specific registers are not affected by a
return from SMM.

The SMM state map used by RSM supports resuming processor context for
non-64-bit modes and 64-bit mode.

See Chapter 34, “System Management Mode,” in the _Intel® 64 and IA-32
Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 3C_, for more
information about SMM and the behavior of the RSM instruction.


Operation ¶

    ReturnFromSMM;
    IF (IA-32e mode supported) or (CPUID DisplayFamily_DisplayModel = 06H_0CH )
        THEN
            ProcessorState ← Restore(SMMDump(IA-32e SMM STATE MAP));
        Else
            ProcessorState ← Restore(SMMDump(Non-32-Bit-Mode SMM STATE MAP));
    FI


Flags Affected ¶

All.


Protected Mode Exceptions ¶

#UD

If an attempt is made to execute this instruction when the processor is
not in SMM.

If the LOCK prefix is used.


Real-Address Mode Exceptions ¶

Same exceptions as in protected mode.


Virtual-8086 Mode Exceptions ¶

Same exceptions as in protected mode.


Compatibility Mode Exceptions ¶

Same exceptions as in protected mode.


64-Bit Mode Exceptions ¶

Same exceptions as in protected mode.
