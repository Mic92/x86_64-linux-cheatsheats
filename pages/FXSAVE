Description ¶

Saves the current state of the x87 FPU, MMX technology, XMM, and MXCSR
registers to a 512-byte memory location specified in the destination
operand. The content layout of the 512 byte region depends on whether
the processor is operating in non-64-bit operating modes or 64-bit
sub-mode of IA-32e mode.

Bytes 464:511 are available to software use. The processor does not
write to bytes 464:511 of an FXSAVE area.

The operation of FXSAVE in non-64-bit modes is described first.


Non-64-Bit Mode Operation ¶

Table 3-43 shows the layout of the state information in memory when the
processor is operating in legacy modes.

Table 3-43. Non-64-bit-Mode Layout of FXSAVE and FXRSTOR Memory Region

The destination operand contains the first byte of the memory image, and
it must be aligned on a 16-byte boundary. A misaligned destination
operand will result in a general-protection (#GP) exception being
generated (or in some cases, an alignment check exception [#AC]).

The FXSAVE instruction is used when an operating system needs to perform
a context switch or when an exception handler needs to save and examine
the current state of the x87 FPU, MMX technology, and/or XMM and MXCSR
registers.

The fields in Table 3-43 are defined in Table 3-44.

  FSW                       x87 FPU Status Word (16 bits). See Figure 8-4 in the _Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1_, for the layout of the x87 FPU status word.
  Abridged FTW              x87 FPU Tag Word (8 bits). The tag information saved here is abridged, as described in the following paragraphs.
  FOP                       x87 FPU Opcode (16 bits). The lower 11 bits of this field contain the opcode, upper 5 bits are reserved. See Figure 8-8 in the _Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1_, for the layout of the x87 FPU opcode field.
  FIP                       x87 FPU Instruction Pointer Offset (64 bits). The contents of this field differ depending on the current addressing mode (32-bit, 16-bit, or 64-bit) of the processor when the FXSAVE instruction was executed: 32-bit mode — 32-bit IP offset. 16-bit mode — low 16 bits are IP offset; high 16 bits are reserved. 64-bit mode with REX.W — 64-bit IP offset. 64-bit mode without REX.W — 32-bit IP offset. See “x87 FPU Instruction and Operand (Data) Pointers” in Chapter 8 of the _Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1_, for a description of the x87 FPU instruction pointer.
  FCS                       x87 FPU Instruction Pointer Selector (16 bits). If CPUID.(EAX=07H,ECX=0H):EBX[bit 13] = 1, the processor deprecates FCS and FDS, and this field is saved as 0000H.
  FDP                       x87 FPU Instruction Operand (Data) Pointer Offset (64 bits). The contents of this field differ depending on the current addressing mode (32-bit, 16-bit, or 64-bit) of the processor when the FXSAVE instruction was executed: 32-bit mode — 32-bit DP offset. 16-bit mode — low 16 bits are DP offset; high 16 bits are reserved. 64-bit mode with REX.W — 64-bit DP offset. 64-bit mode without REX.W — 32-bit DP offset. See “x87 FPU Instruction and Operand (Data) Pointers” in Chapter 8 of the _Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1_, for a description of the x87 FPU operand pointer.

  MXCSR                     MXCSR Register State (32 bits). See Figure 10-3 in the _Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1_, for the layout of the MXCSR register. If the OSFXSR bit in control register CR4 is not set, the FXSAVE instruction may not save this register. This behavior is implementation dependent.
  MXCSR_ MASK               MXCSR_MASK (32 bits). This mask can be used to adjust values written to the MXCSR register, ensuring that reserved bits are set to 0. Set the mask bits and flags in MXCSR to the mode of operation desired for SSE and SSE2 SIMD floating-point instructions. See “Guidelines for Writing to the MXCSR Register” in Chapter 11 of the _Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1_, for instructions for how to determine and use the MXCSR_MASK value.
  ST0/MM0 through ST7/MM7   x87 FPU or MMX technology registers. These 80-bit fields contain the x87 FPU data registers or the MMX technology registers, depending on the state of the processor prior to the execution of the FXSAVE instruction. If the processor had been executing x87 FPU instruction prior to the FXSAVE instruction, the x87 FPU data registers are saved; if it had been executing MMX instructions (or SSE or SSE2 instructions that operated on the MMX technology registers), the MMX technology registers are saved. When the MMX technology registers are saved, the high 16 bits of the field are reserved.
  XMM0 through XMM7         XMM registers (128 bits per field). If the OSFXSR bit in control register CR4 is not set, the FXSAVE instruction may not save these registers. This behavior is implementation dependent.

Table 3-44. Field Definitions

The FXSAVE instruction saves an abridged version of the x87 FPU tag word
in the FTW field (unlike the FSAVE instruction, which saves the complete
tag word). The tag information is saved in physical register order (R0
through R7), rather than in top-of-stack (TOS) order. With the FXSAVE
instruction, however, only a single bit (1 for valid or 0 for empty) is
saved for each tag. For example, assume that the tag word is currently
set as follows:

R7 R6 R5 R4 R3 R2 R1 R0

11 xx xx xx 11 11 11 11

Here, 11B indicates empty stack elements and “xx” indicates valid (00B),
zero (01B), or special (10B).

For this example, the FXSAVE instruction saves only the following 8 bits
of information:

R7 R6 R5 R4 R3 R2 R1 R0

01110000

Here, a 1 is saved for any valid, zero, or special tag, and a 0 is saved
for any empty tag.

The operation of the FXSAVE instruction differs from that of the FSAVE
instruction, the as follows:

-   FXSAVE instruction does not check for pending unmasked
    floating-point exceptions. (The FXSAVE operation in this regard is
    similar to the operation of the FNSAVE instruction).
-   After the FXSAVE instruction has saved the state of the x87 FPU, MMX
    technology, XMM, and MXCSR registers, the processor retains the
    contents of the registers. Because of this behavior, the FXSAVE
    instruction cannot be used by an application program to pass a
    “clean” x87 FPU state to a procedure, since it retains the current
    state. To clean the x87 FPU state, an application must explicitly
    execute an FINIT instruction after an FXSAVE instruction to
    reinitialize the x87 FPU state.
-   The format of the memory image saved with the FXSAVE instruction is
    the same regardless of the current addressing mode (32-bit or
    16-bit) and operating mode (protected, real address, or system
    management). This behavior differs from the FSAVE instructions,
    where the memory image format is different depending on the
    addressing mode and operating mode. Because of the different image
    formats, the memory image saved with the FXSAVE instruction cannot
    be restored correctly with the FRSTOR instruction, and likewise the
    state saved with the FSAVE instruction cannot be restored correctly
    with the FXRSTOR instruction.

The FSAVE format for FTW can be recreated from the FTW valid bits and
the stored 80-bit FP data (assuming the stored data was not the contents
of MMX technology registers) using Table 3-45.

Table 3-45. Recreating FSAVE Format

The J-bit is defined to be the 1-bit binary integer to the left of the
decimal place in the significand. The M-bit is defined to be the most
significant bit of the fractional portion of the significand (i.e., the
bit immediately to the right of the decimal place).

When the M-bit is the most significant bit of the fractional portion of
the significand, it must be 0 if the fraction is all 0’s.


IA-32e Mode Operation ¶

In compatibility sub-mode of IA-32e mode, legacy SSE registers, XMM0
through XMM7, are saved according to the legacy FXSAVE map. In 64-bit
mode, all of the SSE registers, XMM0 through XMM15, are saved.
Additionally, there are two different layouts of the FXSAVE map in
64-bit mode, corresponding to FXSAVE64 (which requires REX.W=1) and
FXSAVE (REX.W=0). In the FXSAVE64 map (Table 3-46), the FPU IP and FPU
DP pointers are 64-bit wide. In the FXSAVE map for 64-bit mode (Table
3-47), the FPU IP and FPU DP pointers are 32-bits.

            DEST ← SaveLegacyFxsave(x87 FPU, MMX, XMM7-XMM0, MXCSR);
    FI;


Protected Mode Exceptions ¶

#GP(0)

For an illegal memory operand effective address in the CS, DS, ES, FS or
GS segments.

If a memory operand is not aligned on a 16-byte boundary, regardless of
segment. (See the description of the alignment check exception [#AC]
below.)

#SS(0)

For an illegal address in the SS segment.

#PF(fault-code)

For a page fault.

#NM

If CR0.TS[bit 3] = 1.

If CR0.EM[bit 2] = 1.

#UD

If CPUID.01H:EDX.FXSR[bit 24] = 0.

#UD

If the LOCK prefix is used.

#AC

If this exception is disabled a general protection exception (#GP) is
signaled if the memory operand is not aligned on a 16-byte boundary, as
described above. If the alignment check exception (#AC) is enabled (and
the CPL is 3), signaling of #AC is not guaranteed and may vary with
implementation, as follows. In all implementations where #AC is not
signaled, a general protection exception is signaled in its place. In
addition, the width of the alignment check may also vary with
implementation. For instance, for a given implementation, an alignment
check exception might be signaled for a 2-byte misalignment, whereas a
general protection exception might be signaled for all other
misalignments (4-, 8-, or 16-byte misalignments).


Real-Address Mode Exceptions ¶

#GP

If a memory operand is not aligned on a 16-byte boundary, regardless of
segment.

If any part of the operand lies outside the effective address space from
0 to FFFFH.

#NM

If CR0.TS[bit 3] = 1.

If CR0.EM[bit 2] = 1.

#UD

If CPUID.01H:EDX.FXSR[bit 24] = 0.

If the LOCK prefix is used.


Virtual-8086 Mode Exceptions ¶

Same exceptions as in real address mode.

  ----------------- ---------------------------------
  #PF(fault-code)   For a page fault.
  #AC               For unaligned memory reference.
  #UD               If the LOCK prefix is used.
  ----------------- ---------------------------------


Compatibility Mode Exceptions ¶

Same exceptions as in protected mode.


64-Bit Mode Exceptions ¶

#SS(0)

If a memory address referencing the SS segment is in a non-canonical
form.

#GP(0)

If the memory address is in a non-canonical form.

If memory operand is not aligned on a 16-byte boundary, regardless of
segment.

#PF(fault-code)

For a page fault.

#NM

If CR0.TS[bit 3] = 1.

If CR0.EM[bit 2] = 1.

#UD

If CPUID.01H:EDX.FXSR[bit 24] = 0.

If the LOCK prefix is used.

#AC

If this exception is disabled a general protection exception (#GP) is
signaled if the memory operand is not aligned on a 16-byte boundary, as
described above. If the alignment check exception (#AC) is enabled (and
the CPL is 3), signaling of #AC is not guaranteed and may vary with
implementation, as follows. In all implementations where #AC is not
signaled, a general protection exception is signaled in its place. In
addition, the width of the alignment check may also vary with
implementation. For instance, for a given implementation, an alignment
check exception might be signaled for a 2-byte misalignment, whereas a
general protection exception might be signaled for all other
misalignments (4-, 8-, or 16-byte misalignments).


Implementation Note ¶

The order in which the processor signals general-protection (#GP) and
page-fault (#PF) exceptions when they both occur on an instruction
boundary is given in Table 5-2 in the _Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures
Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 3B_. This order vary for FXSAVE for
different processor implementations.

This UNOFFICIAL, mechanically-separated, non-verified reference is
provided for convenience, but it may be incomplete or b_(r)oke_(n) in
various obvious or non-obvious ways. Refer to Intel® 64 and IA-32
Architectures Software Developer’s Manual for anything serious.
