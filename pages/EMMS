Description¶

Sets the values of all the tags in the x87 FPU tag word to empty (all
1s). This operation marks the x87 FPU data registers (which are aliased
to the MMX technology registers) as available for use by x87 FPU
floating-point instructions. (See Figure 8-7 in the _Intel® 64 and IA-32
Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1_, for the format of
the x87 FPU tag word.) All other MMX instructions (other than the EMMS
instruction) set all the tags in x87 FPU tag word to valid (all 0s).

The EMMS instruction must be used to clear the MMX technology state at
the end of all MMX technology procedures or subroutines and before
calling other procedures or subroutines that may execute x87
floating-point instructions. If a floating-point instruction loads one
of the registers in the x87 FPU data register stack before the x87 FPU
tag word has been reset by the EMMS instruction, an x87 floating-point
register stack overflow can occur that will result in an x87
floating-point exception or incorrect result.

EMMS operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit mode.


Operation¶
