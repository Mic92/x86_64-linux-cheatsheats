VMLAUNCH/VMRESUME — Launch/Resume Virtual Machine

  Opcode/Instruction   Op/En   Description
  -------------------- ------- -------------------------------------------------
  0F 01 C2 VMLAUNCH    ZO      Launch virtual machine managed by current VMCS.
  0F 01 C3 VMRESUME    ZO      Resume virtual machine managed by current VMCS.

Description ¶

Effects a VM entry managed by the current VMCS.

-   VMLAUNCH fails if the launch state of current VMCS is not “clear”.
    If the instruction is successful, it sets the launch state to
    “launched.”
-   VMRESUME fails if the launch state of the current VMCS is not
    “launched.”

If VM entry is attempted, the logical processor performs a series of
consistency checks as detailed in Chapter 26, “VM Entries”. Failure to
pass checks on the VMX controls or on the host-state area passes control
to the instruction following the VMLAUNCH or VMRESUME instruction. If
these pass but checks on the guest-state area fail, the logical
processor loads state from the host-state area of the VMCS, passing
control to the instruction referenced by the RIP field in the host-state
area.

VM entry is not allowed when events are blocked by MOV SS or POP SS.
Neither VMLAUNCH nor VMRESUME should be used immediately after either
MOV to SS or POP to SS.

Operation ¶

    IF (not in VMX operation) or (CR0.PE = 0) or (RFLAGS.VM = 1) or (IA32_EFER.LMA = 1 and CS.L = 0)

    ELSIF (VMLAUNCH and launch state of current VMCS is not “clear”)
        THEN VMfailValid(VMLAUNCH with non-clear VMCS);
    ELSIF (VMRESUME and launch state of current VMCS is not “launched”)
        THEN VMfailValid(VMRESUME with non-launched VMCS);
