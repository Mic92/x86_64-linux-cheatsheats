Description ¶

Moves the doubleword integer in the source operand (second operand) to
the destination operand (first operand) using a direct-store operation.
The source operand is a general purpose register. The destination
operand is a 32-bit memory location. In 64-bit mode, the instruction’s
default operation size is 32 bits. Use of the REX.R prefix permits
access to additional registers (R8-R15). Use of the REX.W prefix
promotes operation to 64 bits. See summary chart at the beginning of
this section for encoding data and limits.

The direct-store is implemented by using write combining (WC) memory
type protocol for writing data. Using this protocol, the processor does
not write the data into the cache hierarchy, nor does it fetch the
corresponding cache line from memory into the cache hierarchy. If the
destination address is cached, the line is written-back (if modified)
and invalidated from the cache, before the direct-store. Unlike stores
with non-temporal hint that allow uncached (UC) and write-protected (WP)
memory-type for the destination to override the non-temporal hint,
direct-stores always follow WC memory type protocol irrespective of the
destination address memory type (including UC and WP types).

Unlike WC stores and stores with non-temporal hint, direct-stores are
eligible for immediate eviction from the write-combining buffer, and
thus not combined with younger stores (including direct-stores) to the
same address. Older WC and non-temporal stores held in the write-combing
buffer may be combined with younger direct stores to the same address.
Because WC protocol used by direct-stores follows a weakly-ordered
memory consistency model, a fencing operation using SFENCE or MFENCE
should follow the MOVDIRI instruction to enforce ordering when needed.

Direct-stores issued by MOVDIRI to a destination aligned to a 4-byte
boundary (8-byte boundary if used with REX.W prefix) guarantee 4-byte
(8-byte with REX.W prefix) write-completion atomicity. This means that
the data arrives at the destination in a single undivided 4-byte (or
8-byte) write transaction. If the destination is not aligned for the
write size, the direct-stores issued by MOVDIRI are split and arrive at
the destination in two parts. Each part of such split direct-store will
not merge with younger stores but can arrive at the destination in
either order. Availability of the MOVDIRI instruction is indicated by
the presence of the CPUID feature flag MOVDIRI (bit 27 of the ECX
register in leaf 07H, see “CPUID—CPU Identification” in the _Intel® 64
and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 2A_).

This UNOFFICIAL, mechanically-separated, non-verified reference is
provided for convenience, but it may be incomplete or b_(r)oke_(n) in
various obvious or non-obvious ways. Refer to Intel® 64 and IA-32
Architectures Software Developer’s Manual for anything serious.
