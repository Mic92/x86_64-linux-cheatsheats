Description ¶

The instruction marks the end of an RTM code region. If this corresponds
to the outermost scope (that is, including this XEND instruction, the
number of XBEGIN instructions is the same as number of XEND
instructions), the logical processor will attempt to commit the logical
processor state atomically. If the commit fails, the logical processor
will rollback all architectural register and memory updates performed
during the RTM execution. The logical processor will resume execution at
the fallback address computed from the outermost XBEGIN instruction. The
EAX register is updated to reflect RTM abort information.

XEND executed outside a transactional region will cause a #GP (General
Protection Fault).


Operation ¶

    IF (RTM_ACTIVE = 0) THEN
        SIGNAL #GP
