Description ¶

Computes the absolute value of the difference of 8 unsigned byte
integers from the source operand (second operand) and from the
destination operand (first operand). These 8 differences are then summed
to produce an unsigned word integer result that is stored in the
destination operand. Figure 4-14 shows the operation of the PSADBW
instruction when using 64-bit operands.

When operating on 64-bit operands, the word integer result is stored in
the low word of the destination operand, and the remaining bytes in the
destination operand are cleared to all 0s.

When operating on 128-bit operands, two packed results are computed.
Here, the 8 low-order bytes of the source and destination operands are
operated on to produce a word result that is stored in the low word of
the destination operand, and the 8 high-order bytes are operated on to
produce a word result that is stored in bits 64 through 79 of the
destination operand. The remaining bytes of the destination operand are
cleared.

For 256-bit version, the third group of 8 differences are summed to
produce an unsigned word in bits[143:128] of the destination register
and the fourth group of 8 differences are summed to produce an unsigned
word in bits[207:192] of the destination register. The remaining words
of the destination are set to 0.

For 512-bit version, the fifth group result is stored in bits [271:256]
of the destination. The result from the sixth group is stored in bits
[335:320]. The results for the seventh and eighth group are stored
respectively in bits [399:384] and bits [463:447], respectively. The
remaining bits in the destination are set to 0.

In 64-bit mode and not encoded by VEX/EVEX prefix, using a REX prefix in
the form of REX.R permits this instruction to access additional
registers (XMM8-XMM15).

Legacy SSE version: The source operand can be an MMX technology register
or a 64-bit memory location. The destination operand is an MMX
technology register.

128-bit Legacy SSE version: The first source operand and destination
register are XMM registers. The second source operand is an XMM register
or a 128-bit memory location. Bits (MAXVL-1:128) of the corresponding
ZMM destination register remain unchanged.

VEX.128 and EVEX.128 encoded versions: The first source operand and
destination register are XMM registers. The second source operand is an
XMM register or a 128-bit memory location. Bits (MAXVL-1:128) of the
corresponding ZMM register are zeroed.

VEX.256 and EVEX.256 encoded versions: The first source operand and
destination register are YMM registers. The second source operand is an
YMM register or a 256-bit memory location. Bits (MAXVL-1:256) of the
corresponding ZMM register are zeroed.

EVEX.512 encoded version: The first source operand and destination
register are ZMM registers. The second source operand is a ZMM register
or a 512-bit memory location.
