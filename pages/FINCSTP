FINCSTP — INCREMENT STACK-TOP POINTER


  Opcode   Instruction   64-Bit Mode   Compat/Leg Mode   Description
  -------- ------------- ------------- ----------------- -----------------------------------------------------
  D9 F7    FINCSTP       Valid         Valid             Increment the TOP field in the FPU status register.


Description ¶

Adds one to the TOP field of the FPU status word (increments the
top-of-stack pointer). If the TOP field contains a 7, it is set to 0.
The effect of this instruction is to rotate the stack by one position.
The contents of the FPU data registers and tag register are not
affected. This operation is not equivalent to popping the stack, because
the tag for the previous top-of-stack register is not marked empty.

This instruction’s operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit
mode.


Operation ¶

    IF TOP = 7
        THEN TOP ← 0;
        ELSE TOP ← TOP + 1;
    FI;


FPU Flags Affected ¶

The C1 flag is set to 0. The C0, C2, and C3 flags are undefined.


Floating-Point Exceptions ¶

None


Protected Mode Exceptions ¶

  ----- ------------------------------------------
  #NM   CR0.EM[bit 2] or CR0.TS[bit 3] = 1.
  #MF   If there is a pending x87 FPU exception.
  #UD   If the LOCK prefix is used.
  ----- ------------------------------------------


Real-Address Mode Exceptions ¶

Same exceptions as in protected mode.


Virtual-8086 Mode Exceptions ¶

Same exceptions as in protected mode.


Compatibility Mode Exceptions ¶
