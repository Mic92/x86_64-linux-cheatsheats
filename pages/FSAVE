  * SeeIA-32ArchitectureCompatibilitysectionbelow.

Description ¶

Stores the current FPU state (operating environment and register stack)
at the specified destination in memory, and then re-initializes the FPU.
The FSAVE instruction checks for and handles pending unmasked
floating-point exceptions before storing the FPU state; the FNSAVE
instruction does not.

The FPU operating environment consists of the FPU control word, status
word, tag word, instruction pointer, data pointer, and last opcode.
Figures 8-9 through 8-12 in the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures
Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1, show the layout in memory of the
stored environment, depending on the operating mode of the processor
(protected or real) and the current operand-size attribute (16-bit or
32-bit). In virtual-8086 mode, the real mode layouts are used. The
contents of the FPU register stack are stored in the 80 bytes
immediately follow the operating environment image.

The saved image reflects the state of the FPU after all floating-point
instructions preceding the FSAVE/FNSAVE instruction in the instruction
stream have been executed.

After the FPU state has been saved, the FPU is reset to the same default
values it is set to with the FINIT/FNINIT instructions (see
“FINIT/FNINIT—Initialize Floating-Point Unit” in this chapter).

The FSAVE/FNSAVE instructions are typically used when the operating
system needs to perform a context switch, an exception handler needs to
use the FPU, or an application program needs to pass a “clean” FPU to a
procedure.

The assembler issues two instructions for the FSAVE instruction (an
FWAIT instruction followed by an FNSAVE instruction), and the processor
executes each of these instructions separately. If an exception is
generated for either of these instructions, the save EIP points to the
instruction that caused the exception.

This instruction’s operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit
mode.

IA-32 Architecture Compatibility ¶

For Intel math coprocessors and FPUs prior to the Intel Pentium
processor, an FWAIT instruction should be executed before attempting to
read from the memory image stored with a prior FSAVE/FNSAVE instruction.
This FWAIT instruction helps ensure that the storage operation has been
completed.

When operating a Pentium or Intel486 processor in MS-DOS compatibility
mode, it is possible (under unusual circumstances) for an FNSAVE
instruction to be interrupted prior to being executed to handle a
pending FPU exception. See the section titled “No-Wait FPU Instructions
Can Get FPU Interrupt in Window” in Appendix D of the Intel® 64 and
IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1, for a
description of these circumstances. An FNSAVE instruction cannot be
interrupted in this way on later Intel processors, except for the Intel
Quark^(TM) X1000 processor.
