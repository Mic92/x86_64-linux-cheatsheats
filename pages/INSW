Description ¶

Copies the data from the I/O port specified with the source operand
(second operand) to the destination operand (first operand). The source
operand is an I/O port address (from 0 to 65,535) that is read from the
DX register. The destination operand is a memory location, the address
of which is read from either the ES:DI, ES:EDI or the RDI registers
(depending on the address-size attribute of the instruction, 16, 32 or
64, respectively). (The ES segment cannot be overridden with a segment
override prefix.) The size of the I/O port being accessed (that is, the
size of the source and destination operands) is determined by the opcode
for an 8-bit I/O port or by the operand-size attribute of the
instruction for a 16- or 32-bit I/O port.

At the assembly-code level, two forms of this instruction are allowed:
the “explicit-operands” form and the “no-operands” form. The
explicit-operands form (specified with the INS mnemonic) allows the
source and destination operands to be specified explicitly. Here, the
source operand must be “DX,” and the destination operand should be a
symbol that indicates the size of the I/O port and the destination
address. This explicit-operands form is provided to allow documentation;
however, note that the documentation provided by this form can be
misleading. That is, the destination operand symbol must specify the
correct TYPE (size) of the operand (byte, word, or doubleword), but it
does not have to specify the correct LOCATION. The location is always
specified by the ES:(E)DI registers, which must be loaded correctly
before the INS instruction is executed.

The no-operands form provides “short forms” of the byte, word, and
doubleword versions of the INS instructions. Here also DX is assumed by
the processor to be the source operand and ES:(E)DI is assumed to be the
destination operand. The size of the I/O port is specified with the
choice of mnemonic: INSB (byte), INSW (word), or INSD (doubleword).

After the byte, word, or doubleword is transfer from the I/O port to the
memory location, the DI/EDI/RDI register is incremented or decremented
automatically according to the setting of the DF flag in the EFLAGS
register. (If the DF flag is 0, the (E)DI register is incremented; if
the DF flag is 1, the (E)DI register is decremented.) The (E)DI register
is incremented or decremented by 1 for byte operations, by 2 for word
operations, or by 4 for doubleword operations.

The INS, INSB, INSW, and INSD instructions can be preceded by the REP
prefix for block input of ECX bytes, words, or doublewords. See
“REP/REPE/REPZ /REPNE/REPNZ—Repeat String Operation Prefix” in Chapter 4
of the _Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual,
Volume 2B_, for a description of the REP prefix.

These instructions are only useful for accessing I/O ports located in
the processor’s I/O address space. See Chapter 18, “Input/Output,” in
the _Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual,
Volume 1_, for more information on accessing I/O ports in the I/O
address space.

In 64-bit mode, default address size is 64 bits, 32 bit address size is
supported using the prefix 67H. The address of the memory destination is
specified by RDI or EDI. 16-bit address size is not supported in 64-bit
mode. The operand size is not promoted.

These instructions may read from the I/O port without writing to the
memory location if an exception or VM exit occurs due to the write (e.g.
#PF). If this would be problematic, for example because the I/O port
read has side-effects, software should ensure the write to the memory
location does not cause an exception or VM exit.
