Description ¶

Causes the processor to check for and handle pending, unmasked,
floating-point exceptions before proceeding. (FWAIT is an alternate
mnemonic for WAIT.)

This instruction is useful for synchronizing exceptions in critical
sections of code. Coding a WAIT instruction after a floating-point
instruction ensures that any unmasked floating-point exceptions the
instruction may raise are handled before the processor can modify the
instruction’s results. See the section titled “Floating-Point Exception
Synchronization” in Chapter 8 of the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures
Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1, for more information on using the
WAIT/FWAIT instruction.

This instruction’s operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit
mode.

Operation ¶

    CheckForPendingUnmaskedFloatingPointExceptions;

FPU Flags Affected ¶

The C0, C1, C2, and C3 flags are undefined.

Floating-Point Exceptions ¶

None.

Protected Mode Exceptions ¶

  ----- ---------------------------------------------
  #NM   If CR0.MP[bit 1] = 1 and CR0.TS[bit 3] = 1.
  #UD   If the LOCK prefix is used.
  ----- ---------------------------------------------

Real-Address Mode Exceptions ¶

Same exceptions as in protected mode.

Virtual-8086 Mode Exceptions ¶

Same exceptions as in protected mode.

Compatibility Mode Exceptions ¶

Same exceptions as in protected mode.

64-Bit Mode Exceptions ¶

Same exceptions as in protected mode.
