Description ¶

In non-64-bit and default 64-bit mode; stores a byte, word, or
doubleword from the AL, AX, or EAX register (respectively) into the
destination operand. The destination operand is a memory location, the
address of which is read from either the ES:EDI or ES:DI register
(depending on the address-size attribute of the instruction and the mode
of operation). The ES segment cannot be overridden with a segment
override prefix.

At the assembly-code level, two forms of the instruction are allowed:
the “explicit-operands” form and the “no-operands” form. The
explicit-operands form (specified with the STOS mnemonic) allows the
destination operand to be specified explicitly. Here, the destination
operand should be a symbol that indicates the size and location of the
destination value. The source operand is then automatically selected to
match the size of the destination operand (the AL register for byte
operands, AX for word operands, EAX for doubleword operands). The
explicit-operands form is provided to allow documentation; however, note
that the documentation provided by this form can be misleading. That is,
the destination operand symbol must specify the correct type (size) of
the operand (byte, word, or doubleword), but it does not have to specify
the correct location. The location is always specified by the ES:(E)DI
register. These must be loaded correctly before the store string
instruction is executed.

The no-operands form provides “short forms” of the byte, word,
doubleword, and quadword versions of the STOS instructions. Here also
ES:(E)DI is assumed to be the destination operand and AL, AX, or EAX is
assumed to be the source operand. The size of the destination and source
operands is selected by the mnemonic: STOSB (byte read from register
AL), STOSW (word from AX), STOSD (doubleword from EAX).

After the byte, word, or doubleword is transferred from the register to
the memory location, the (E)DI register is incremented or decremented
according to the setting of the DF flag in the EFLAGS register. If the
DF flag is 0, the register is incremented; if the DF flag is 1, the
register is decremented (the register is incremented or decremented by 1
for byte operations, by 2 for word operations, by 4 for doubleword
operations).

NOTE: To improve performance, more recent processors support
modifications to the processor’s operation during the string store
operations initiated with STOS and STOSB. See Section 7.3.9.3 in the
Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1
for additional information on fast-string operation.

In 64-bit mode, the default address size is 64 bits, 32-bit address size
is supported using the prefix 67H. Using a REX prefix in the form of
REX.W promotes operation on doubleword operand to 64 bits. The promoted
no-operand mnemonic is STOSQ. STOSQ (and its explicit operands variant)
store a quadword from the RAX register into the destination addressed by
RDI or EDI. See the summary chart at the beginning of this section for
encoding data and limits.

The STOS, STOSB, STOSW, STOSD, STOSQ instructions can be preceded by the
REP prefix for block loads of ECX bytes, words, or doublewords. More
often, however, these instructions are used within a LOOP construct
because data needs to be moved into the AL, AX, or EAX register before
it can be stored. See “REP/REPE/REPZ /REPNE/REPNZ—Repeat String
Operation Prefix” in this chapter for a description of the REP prefix.

        THEN
            DEST ← AL;
                THEN IF DF = 0
                    THEN (E)DI ← (E)DI + 1;
                    ELSE (E)DI ← (E)DI – 1;
                FI;
        ELSE IF (Word store)
            THEN
