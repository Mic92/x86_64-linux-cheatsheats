Description¶

Adjusts the result of the multiplication of two unpacked BCD values to
create a pair of unpacked (base 10) BCD values. The AX register is the
implied source and destination operand for this instruction. The AAM
instruction is only useful when it follows an MUL instruction that
multiplies (binary multiplication) two unpacked BCD values and stores a
word result in the AX register. The AAM instruction then adjusts the
contents of the AX register to contain the correct 2-digit unpacked
(base 10) BCD result.

The generalized version of this instruction allows adjustment of the
contents of the AX to create two unpacked digits of any number base (see
the “Operation” section below). Here, the _imm8_ byte is set to the
selected number base (for example, 08H for octal, 0AH for decimal, or
0CH for base 12 numbers). The AAM mnemonic is interpreted by all
assemblers to mean adjust to ASCII (base 10) values. To adjust to values
in another number base, the instruction must be hand coded in machine
code (D4 _imm8_).

This instruction executes as described in compatibility mode and legacy
mode. It is not valid in 64-bit mode.


Operation¶

    IF 64-Bit Mode
        THEN
            #UD;
        ELSE
            tempAL ← AL;
            AH ← tempAL / imm8; (* imm8 is set to 0AH for the AAM mnemonic *)
            AL ← tempAL MOD imm8;
    FI;
    The immediate value (imm8) is taken from the second byte of the instruction.


Flags Affected¶

The SF, ZF, and PF flags are set according to the resulting binary value
in the AL register. The OF, AF, and CF flags are undefined.


Protected Mode Exceptions¶

  ----- -------------------------------------
  #DE   If an immediate value of 0 is used.
  #UD   If the LOCK prefix is used.
  ----- -------------------------------------


Real-Address Mode Exceptions¶

Same exceptions as protected mode.


Virtual-8086 Mode Exceptions¶

Same exceptions as protected mode.


Compatibility Mode Exceptions¶

Same exceptions as protected mode.


64-Bit Mode Exceptions¶

  ----- --------------------
  #UD   If in 64-bit mode.
